## Description

This C++ library provides routines for constructing and working with the intermediate representation of correlation functions. It provides:

- on-the-fly computation of basis functions for arbitrary cutoff Î›
- basis functions and singular values are accurate to full precision
- routines for sparse sampling

We use [tuwien-cms/libxprec](https://github.com/tuwien-cms/libxprec) as a double-double precision arithmetic library.


## Building and Installation

### Dependencies

- **CMake** (>= 3.10)
- **C++ compiler** with C++11 support
- **Fortran compiler** (optional, for Fortran bindings)

All other dependencies (including libxprec) are automatically downloaded and built during the build process using CMake's FetchContent feature. You do not need to install these manually.

### Using Build Scripts

Three build scripts are provided for easy building and installation:

1. **build_capi.sh**: Builds and installs only the C API
   ```bash
   ./build_capi.sh
   ```

2. **build_fortran.sh**: Builds and installs the C API and Fortran bindings
   ```bash
   ./build_fortran.sh
   ```

3. **build_with_tests.sh**: Builds everything including tests
   ```bash
   ./build_with_tests.sh
   # After testing, you can install with:
   cd build && cmake --install .
   ```

By default, all scripts will install to `$HOME/opt/libsparseir`. You can override this by setting the `CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX` environment variable:

```bash
CMAKE_INSTALL_PREFIX=/usr/local ./build_capi.sh
```

### Manual Build

If you prefer to build manually, you can use the following commands:

```bash
mkdir -p build
cd build
# For C API only
cmake .. -DSPARSEIR_BUILD_FORTRAN=OFF -DSPARSEIR_BUILD_TESTING=OFF
# For C API and Fortran bindings
cmake .. -DSPARSEIR_BUILD_FORTRAN=ON -DSPARSEIR_BUILD_TESTING=OFF
# For everything including tests
cmake .. -DSPARSEIR_BUILD_FORTRAN=ON -DSPARSEIR_BUILD_TESTING=ON

# Build
cmake --build .

# Install
cmake --install .
```



### Quick Test Build

For a quick test build with all options enabled:

```sh
rm -rf ./build && cmake -S . -B ./build -DSPARSEIR_BUILD_TESTING=ON && cmake --build ./build -j && ./build/test/libsparseirtests
```

### Testing Fortran Bindings

After building with Fortran bindings enabled, you can run the Fortran test:

```bash
cd build
./test_kernel
```

### BLAS Support

By default, the library uses Eigen's internal implementations for matrix-matrix multiplication for fitting and sampling.
This does not require any additional system libraries.
However, the performance is not as good as the BLAS implementation.

For performance critical applications, we recommend using BLAS.
For this, you need to set the `SPARSEIR_USE_BLAS` CMake option to `ON`.

```bash
cmake .. -DSPARSEIR_USE_BLAS=OFF
cmake .. -DSPARSEIR_USE_BLAS=ON
```

Alternatively, you can set the `SPARSEIR_USE_BLAS` CMake option to `ON` in the `CMakeLists.txt` file of your project:

```cmake
cmake_minimum_required(VERSION 3.10)
project(MyProject)

set(SPARSEIR_USE_BLAS ON)
```

Note: When enabling BLAS, ensure that the appropriate libraries (such as OpenBLAS, Intel MKL, or Apple Accelerate) can be found by CMake.

### Debug Logging at runtime

You can also control debug output at runtime using the `SPARSEIR_DEBUG` environment variable:

```bash
export SPARSEIR_DEBUG=1
./your_program
```

## Generating documentation with Doxygen

Install `doxygen` and `graphviz`. Then, run the following command:

```bash
bash generate_docs.sh
```

This will create the `docs/html` directory. Open `docs/html/index.html` with your browser to see it.

## For developers


### CI/CD

This project uses GitHub Actions for continuous integration and automated releases:

- **CI_cmake.yml**: Runs automated tests on every push and pull request to ensure code quality
- **CreateTag.yml**: Automatically creates tags and releases when version numbers are updated in `include/sparseir/version.h`

### Automated Release Process

The release process is fully automated:

1. Update version numbers in `include/sparseir/version.h` by modifying:
   - `SPARSEIR_VERSION_MAJOR`
   - `SPARSEIR_VERSION_MINOR`
   - `SPARSEIR_VERSION_PATCH`

2. Push changes to the main branch

3. The GitHub Action will automatically:
   - Extract the version from the header file
   - Check if a tag with that version already exists
   - Create a new tag and release if the version is new
   - Generate release notes automatically
